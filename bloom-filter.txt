Bloom filters are a probabilistic data structure that allows Cassandra to determine one of two possible states:

1-The data definitely does not exist in the given file (SSTable).
2-The data probably exists in the given file.

An empty Bloom filter is a bit array of m bits, all set to 0. There must also be k different hash functions defined, each of which maps or hashes some set element to one of the m array positions, generating a uniform random distribution.

To query for an element (test whether it is in the RAM), feed it to each of the k hash functions to get k array positions. If any of the bits at these positions is 0, the element is definitely not in the RAM.

While bloom filters can not guarantee that the data exists in a given SSTable, bloom filters can be made more accurate by allowing them to consume more RAM.
